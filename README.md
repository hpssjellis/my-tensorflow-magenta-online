An option for windows users and others to install and use Google's Magenta Music Artificial Intelligence Software online using http://c9.io. Only catch is that you need to pay Cloud9 $19/month for the extra data.

My second attempt to install Google's Music AI Magenta. The first is just for Linux and perhaps only for Ubuntu. It is at 

https://github.com/hpssjellis/google-magenta-midi-music-on-linux-hello-world

This attempt is just for paid versions of Cloud9 http://c9.io at $19/month great platform but the free version does not give enough data (need about 2.5Gb). So do not try this on cloud9 unless you have a paid account.
